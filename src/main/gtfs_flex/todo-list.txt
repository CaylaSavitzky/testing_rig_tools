okay so:



problem:
	this whole thing is a garbage mess of scripts
solution:
	- make proper fricking classes
	- better self identifier for models
	- make dao pattern actually dao pattern even if impl is dicts
	- dao should take class and id and return val & accept obj and put into right location
		- would it make sense to have the dao handle making reciprocal relationships btwn relivant classes? tbh i don't think so, that feels wrong for access obj
	- there are too many situations where things other than objects are being passed around when it *really* should just be objects... <.< looking at you visualize_geo.py

problem:
	gross sidescreen image
solutions:
	1 -
		- add arrows for trips (directionality feature)
		- add tooltip or popup that start as on with traveltimes
		- maintain description as backup in associated txt?
	2 -
		- add a better way to float text
			-A modify the html after map is saved
			-B add plugin to package?
		- allow text scrolling
		- allow text to be dynamically sized

problem:
	regular stop locations which do not travel to flex data should have better printed updates

feature:
	multiple agencies that work by layers
		layer control element - confirm layers work
		id class for models which includes agency and object type
		read multiple files

feature:
	different maps for different days

feature:
	vectors btwn locations arrows
